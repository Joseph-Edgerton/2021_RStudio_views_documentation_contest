# 2021_RStudio_views_documentation_contest

This is my submission to the R Views documentation call. I will submit this Rmarkdown vignette on using geoms to display multiple attributes for the vertices of a network graph.

I haven't seen this visualization style before in other network diagrams and I intend to complement previous documentation that examines using internal values generated for a given network seed.
